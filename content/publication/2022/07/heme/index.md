abstract: "This came from one of the collaborations I worked on during my PhD. Following a similar approach than the one presented in previous publications (for [acetyl/malonyl-CoA](https://www.benjasanchez.com/publication/2019/10/fine-tuning/) and [tryptophan](https://www.benjasanchez.com/publication/2020/09/tryptophan/)), using a variation of a method called flux scanning based on enforced objective flux (FSEOF), we identified reactions that play an important role in heme (an important cofactor for food additives) production in _S. cerevisiae_. These targets were validated experimentally, and the correct predictions were combined in different configurations using an algorithm based on simulations from the enzyme-constrained model of _S. cerevisiae_ (generated using the [GECKO](https://www.benjasanchez.com/publication/2017/06/gecko/) method). The final product, as the title suggests, increased by 70 times the production of heme, showing the success of a computationally-driven method for finding succesful metabolic engineering strategies."
