abstract: "This came from one of the collaborations I worked on during my postdoc. The paper presents CRI-SPA, an experimental method for transferring chromosomal genetic features from a donor strain to large libraries of _S. cerevisiae_. The method is highly efficient, reproducible and scalable, and is promising for systems-level understanding of cellular processes. I was involved in the first implementation of the method, at the data analysis level."
