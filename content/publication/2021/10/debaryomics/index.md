abstract: "This came from one of the collaborations I worked on during my postdoc. _Debaryomyces hansenii_ is a non-conventional yeast of industrial interest, mainly due to its high halotolerance (resistance to high salt levels). To better understand said tolerance, here we performed chemostat cultivations of _D. hansenii_ in the presence of different salts, and studied the transcriptomic and (phospho)proteomic responses under each condition. I mainly provided support on the transcriptomics analyses. The results show that sodium and potassium trigger different responses at both gene expression and protein activity levels. In particular, a novel and yet uncharacterized cation transporter was found associated to the response to high sodium levels."
