abstract: "In this review we cover the genome-scale modeling (GEM) technique and how it has been applied in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. We focus on different ways of evaluating model quality, and different ways of integrating omics data in them. Writing it was a great way for me to study the field and find areas that had not been very explored (e.g. integration of proteomics data)."
