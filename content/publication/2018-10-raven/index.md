abstract: "Here a new release of the RAVEN toolbox (for **R**econstruction, **A**nalysis and **V**isualization of m**E**tabolic **N**etworks) is presented. Its main new features are its redefined pipeline, now constructed around the KEGG and MetaCyc databases, and improved performance/compatibility with the COBRA toolbox. I was mainly involved in the latter feature, working in achieving proper conversion between RAVEN & COBRA model structures. The ease of use of RAVEN is exemplified with the _de novo_ reconstruction of Sco4, a GEM of the antibiotic-producing bacterium
_Streptomyces coelicolor_."
